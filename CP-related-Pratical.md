**1. The mid-point formula**
   - status: **Success after checking discussion**
   - ans: `mid-point = (first-coordinate + second coordinate) / 2`
      - `one-of-the-coordinate = 2*mid-point - the-other-of-the-coordinate`
      - initial-ans:
      ```
      int rx = Math.abs(qx - px) + qx;
      int ry = Math.abs(qy - py) + qy;
      int[] r = {rx, ry};

      return r;
      ```
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      int rx = 2*qx - px;
      int ry = 2*qy - py;
      int[] r = {rx, ry};

      return r;
      ```
   - explanation:
      - The question requires us to find another point named r such that q would be the mid-point.
      - My initial ans is somhow close to the mid-point formula, but however I choose to use `Math,.abs()` method.
      - Absoultely no need to consider the positive or negative.
      - **It is more a problem that I am not using mathematical methods to think of the question first.**
      - **From now on, all scanners are named as `ky`.

**2. maximumDraws(Pigeonhole Principle)**
   - status: **Sucuss**
   - ans: `n = km + 1`
   ```
   Pigeonhole Principle: n = km + 1 or k = (n - 1)/m
   If n items are put into m containers, with n>m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.
   For example, people in London = n, no. of hairs = m.

   for natural numbers k and m, if n=km+1 objects are distributed among m sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least k+1 objects.
   For example, no. of pairs of socks = n, pulls out a sock = m

   Similar to n = object and m = evaluator (something that evaluates(or "contains") the n).
   ```
   - explanation: **From now on, all return variables are named as `r`.**
   
**3. handShakes(~Gauss formula)**
   - status: **Success after checking discussion**
   - ans: `[counts]*[values]/2(i.e. no repetition)`
   - explanation:
      - ** no need to assign another variable if the answer could be calculated in `return`.**
      - **If no mathematical theories can be think of, just use your own logic sense.**

**4. lowestTriangle(area of a triangle)**
   - status: **Success after numerous tries**
   - ans: The problem is that whenever `int` types perform division, it would throw away the remainder.
      1. Either to turn the `int` type into `float`(or `double`) (even just for the dividend).
      2. Or to add `1` or `0` after the division.
      3. Or to force the `int` division to be `rounded-up`.
      - initial ans: 
      ```
      int h = (int)Math.ceil(2*a/b)
      return ;
      ```
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      C++:
      int main() {
      uint32_t a, b;
      cin >> b >> a;
      cout << 2 * a / b + bool((2 * a) % b);   
      return 0;
      }
      C++/Java:
      int lowestTriangle(int base, int area){
      // Complete this function
      return (area * 2 + (base - 1)) / base; // To make it become ceil value
      }
      Java(recommended for me):
      height = (int)Math.ceil((2.0*area)/base);
      ```
   - explanation:
      - The area `a` is just the minimum number, but bigger area could be used.
      - **Constructors and methods cannot be used in a `return`.**
      - **All booleans are named as `rw` from now on.**

**5. primeCount (distinct prime number & varialbes+arrays' limits)**
   - status: **Failed**
   - ans: 
   ```
   Distinct prime number:

   A pair of distinct prime numbers are primes p,q such that pâ‰ q.

   Multiplying two distinct prime numbers pq together gives a composite number whose prime factorization consists only of two primes. 

   This composite number is divisible by 1,p,q,and pq.

   Variables+Arrays' limits:
   About the array length limits:
   - Java array use an integer as an index to the array.
   - The maximum integer stored by JVM is 2^32 = 2,147,483,647 elements.
   - Storing data in the file has no limits as it stored in the storage drivers but array are stored in JVM.

   ```
      - correct-ans: 
         - Either to manually assign a prime array to deal with the problem and to assign an array of primorials to avoid calculating products of the array, performing an equality test in a loop and output the index of the array.
            - The 16th primorial is larger than 2^64 so have to reduce the 16th primorial to fit into 2^64 but keep it larger than 10^18 limit specified by the question.
            - Primorial = a product of the first n primes.p
         ```
         Java:
         static void countPrimeFactors(long N){
            long primes[] = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53};
            // If smaller prime array is used (from 2 to 53), test case 11, 16, 17 would fail.
            // If larger prime array is used (from 2 to 59 or greater), test case 11, 16, 17 would also fail.
            // Passing all test cases is dependent on using Primes array from 2 to 53.
            int count = 0; 
            long pf = primes[0];
                  for(int j = 1; j < primes.length && pf <= N && N != 1; j++){
                      pf = pf * primes[j];
                      count++;
                      }
                  System.out.println(count);  
          } // countPrimeFactors
         ```
         - Or just to calculate maximum primes for every target value (slowest method).
         ```
         C++:
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <stdlib.h>

         unsigned long long int gcd(unsigned long long int a, unsigned long long int b)
         {

            while (b) {
               unsigned long long int t = b;

               b = a % b;
               a = t;
            }
            return a;
         }

         unsigned int max_unique_primes(unsigned long long int n)
         {
            unsigned int count;
            unsigned long long int prod;
            unsigned long long int prim;

            if (n < 2)
               return 0;

            prod = 2;
            count = 1;
            for (prim = 3; prod * prim <= n; prim += 2) {
               if (gcd(prod, prim) == 1) {
                  prod *= prim;
                  count++;
               }
            }
            return count;
         }

         int main(void)
         {
            unsigned int q;

            if (scanf("%u", &q) != 1)
               return EXIT_FAILURE;

            while (q--) {
               unsigned long long int n;

               if (scanf("%llu", &n) != 1)
                  return EXIT_FAILURE;

               printf("%u\n", max_unique_primes(n));
            }
            return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
         ```
   - explanation:
      - The question is asking about what is the maximum factors, that are prime numbers could be found in the corresponding range of n.
      - For example, 3*5*7 = 105, then in the range from 1 to 105, there are at most 3 prime **factors**.
   
**5. connectingTowns(StackOverflowError)**
   - status: **Failed due to some technique issues**
   - ans: 
      - initial-ans:
      ```
      int r = 1;
      for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
         r *= routes[i];
      }
      r %= 1234567;
      return r;
      ```
      - recommended-ans:
      ```
      int r = 1;
      for (int i=0, i < n - 1; i++) {
         r = r*routes[n]%1234567;
      }
      return r;
      ```
   - explanation: 
      - **Remember to initialise all values before using it.**
      - Modulus arthimatic works no matter it is multiple before it or after it.
      - `StackOerflowError`: **Important - May experience multiple times when facing mathematics-related questions.**
         - A runtime error when the amount of call stack memory allocated by JVM is exceeded.
         - A common case is that the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.
      - **From now on, every count would be named as `c`.**
   
**6. cuttingSquares(BigInteger)**
   - status: **Failed**
   - ans: `n*m - 1`
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      Dealing with large integers:
      
      Java(Understandable solution):
      
      static long solve(int n, int m) {
         return BigInteger.valueOf(n).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(m)).longValue()-1;
      }
      
      Java(Intersting solution):

      public class Solution {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
              long m = in.nextLong();
              long n = in.nextLong();
              long cuts = m*n-1;
              System.out.println(cuts);
          }
      }
      
      public class Solution {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
              int n = in.nextInt();
              int m = in.nextInt();
              long result = (long)n*(long)m;
              System.out.println(result - 1);
          }
      }
      ```
   - explanation:
      - A single square takes zero cuts.
      - Every time a piece of paper is cut once to become 2 pieces, adding 1 to the total number of pieces.
      - A rectange of n squares takes `n - 1` cuts, adding rows or columns of m squares, the results would be `n*m - 1`.
         - Regarding the n and m, n*m is the area of the target paper, which is also the no. of papers we needed.
      - The problem is with the multiplication of the inputs, which is in `int` type.
         - The multiplication of `int` types overflows, which starts again from its minimum limit.
         - If any one of the inputs (either `n` or `m` is casted to `long`), the problem could be prevented.
   
**7. movingTiles(Velocity + RunTimeError + Math.cos())**
   - status: **Success after father's help and checking discussion**
   - ans: 
      - `Velocity = Displacement / Change-in-Time`
      - `Area = (x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2) [in time i]`
         - `Area = (l - 0) * (l - 0) [in time 0]`
         - `Area = ((l + s1*cos(45[degree])*i) - s2*cos(45[degree]*i)) * ((l + s1*cos(45[degree])*i) - s2*cos(45[degree]*i))`
         - `Area = (l + (s1 - s2)*cos(45[degree]*i))`
         - `r[i] = Math.abs((Math.sqrt(queries[i]) - l) / ((s1 - s2)*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(45))));`
      - preferred-ans: The given-codes have runtime problem that have to be solved manually.
      ```

               double[] r = new double[queries.length];
               for(int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
                  r[i] = Math.abs((Math.sqrt(queries[i]) - l) / ((s1 - s2)*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(45))));
               }

          }

          private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

          public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

                  queries[queriesItr] = queriesItem;
              }

              scanner.close();
          }
      }
      ```
   - explanation:
      - We have to calculate `i` given the target area, but for simplicity, we just construct a area formula first.
      - `qi` is the target area that we want to calculate, and thus the information we need to find out is the top right point of the square with lower velocity and the bottom left point of the other square with higher velocity.
      - Noticeably, The overlapping area of tiles would become smaller and smaller.
         - Consider the absolute value of the difference in velocities, we get the relative velocity.
         - The velocity is restricted to an angle of 45, which then we evaluate it as cos45 or sin45.
         - The `Math.cos()` receives input of radian instead of degree, which we need a transformation using `Math.toRadian()`.
      - **The `int` data type is often unreliable with mathematical calculations, `long` or `BigInteger` is preferred more.
      - **For all arrays with for loops used, the i should be set at 0 with only "<" used as the condition.**
      
**8. bestDivisor**
   - status:
   - ans:
   - explanation:
      - **The inputs inside and outside of a method can be the same in competitive programming.**
      - **Some methods are self-designed and some are pre-designed, but both of them are methods(seems obvious but actually no).**
      - **No space between the name of methods and constructors and the brackets.**
      - **Remember the variable to be assigned must be put to the left of the equality.**
      - **Boolean flag would be set as `fg` from now on.**
      - **`break` terminates the current loop statement and move on to the next line of codes.**
      - **All inputs for methods would be called `in` if `r` is used.**
      - **All outputs for methods would be called `ot` if `r` is used.**
      - **All smaller variables after should be set with the bigger one with the last vocab.**
      - **The temperary variable from now on would be called `tm`.**
      - **A blank class should be set so to test out small problems in competitive programming(as a beginner).**
      - **If a number cannot be divisible for another number, the output would be 0.**
