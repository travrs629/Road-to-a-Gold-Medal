**1. indPoint(The mid-point formula)**
   - status: **Success after checking discussion**
   - ans: `mid-point = (first-coordinate + second coordinate) / 2`
      - `one-of-the-coordinate = 2*mid-point - the-other-of-the-coordinate`
      - initial-ans:
      ```
      int rx = Math.abs(qx - px) + qx;
      int ry = Math.abs(qy - py) + qy;
      int[] r = {rx, ry};

      return r;
      ```
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      int rx = 2*qx - px;
      int ry = 2*qy - py;
      int[] r = {rx, ry};

      return r;
      ```
   - explanation:
      - The question requires us to find another point named r such that q would be the mid-point.
      - My initial ans is somhow close to the mid-point formula, but however I choose to use `Math,.abs()` method.
      - Absoultely no need to consider the positive or negative.
      - **It is more a problem that I am not using mathematical methods to think of the question first.**
      - **From now on, all scanners are named as `ky`.

**2. maximumDraws(Pigeonhole Principle)**
   - status: **Sucuss**
   - ans: `n = km + 1`
   ```
   Pigeonhole Principle: n = km + 1 or k = (n - 1)/m
   If n items are put into m containers, with n>m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.
   For example, people in London = n, no. of hairs = m.

   for natural numbers k and m, if n=km+1 objects are distributed among m sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least k+1 objects.
   For example, no. of pairs of socks = n, pulls out a sock = m

   Similar to n = object and m = evaluator (something that evaluates(or "contains") the n).
   ```
   - explanation: **From now on, all return variables are named as `r`.**
   
**3. handShakes(~Gauss formula)**
   - status: **Success after checking discussion**
   - ans: `[counts]*[values]/2(i.e. no repetition)`
   - explanation:
      - ** no need to assign another variable if the answer could be calculated in `return`.**
      - **If no mathematical theories can be think of, just use your own logic sense.**

**4. lowestTriangle(area of a triangle)**
   - status: **Success after numerous tries**
   - ans: The problem is that whenever `int` types perform division, it would throw away the remainder.
      1. Either to turn the `int` type into `float`(or `double`) (even just for the dividend).
      2. Or to add `1` or `0` after the division.
      3. Or to force the `int` division to be `rounded-up`.
      - initial ans: 
      ```
      int h = (int)Math.ceil(2*a/b)
      return ;
      ```
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      C++:
      int main() {
      uint32_t a, b;
      cin >> b >> a;
      cout << 2 * a / b + bool((2 * a) % b);   
      return 0;
      }
      C++/Java:
      int lowestTriangle(int base, int area){
      // Complete this function
      return (area * 2 + (base - 1)) / base; // To make it become ceil value
      }
      Java(recommended for me):
      height = (int)Math.ceil((2.0*area)/base);
      ```
   - explanation:
      - The area `a` is just the minimum number, but bigger area could be used.
      - **Constructors and methods cannot be used in a `return`.**
      - **All booleans are named as `rw` from now on.**

**5. primeCount (distinct prime number & varialbes+arrays' limits)**
   - status: **Failed**
   - ans: 
   ```
   Distinct prime number:

   A pair of distinct prime numbers are primes p,q such that pâ‰ q.

   Multiplying two distinct prime numbers pq together gives a composite number whose prime factorization consists only of two primes. 

   This composite number is divisible by 1,p,q,and pq.

   Variables+Arrays' limits:
   About the array length limits:
   - Java array use an integer as an index to the array.
   - The maximum integer stored by JVM is 2^32 = 2,147,483,647 elements.
   - Storing data in the file has no limits as it stored in the storage drivers but array are stored in JVM.

   ```
      - correct-ans: 
         - Either to manually assign a prime array to deal with the problem and to assign an array of primorials to avoid calculating products of the array, performing an equality test in a loop and output the index of the array.
            - The 16th primorial is larger than 2^64 so have to reduce the 16th primorial to fit into 2^64 but keep it larger than 10^18 limit specified by the question.
            - Primorial = a product of the first n primes.p
         ```
         Java:
         static void countPrimeFactors(long N){
            long primes[] = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53};
            // If smaller prime array is used (from 2 to 53), test case 11, 16, 17 would fail.
            // If larger prime array is used (from 2 to 59 or greater), test case 11, 16, 17 would also fail.
            // Passing all test cases is dependent on using Primes array from 2 to 53.
            int count = 0; 
            long pf = primes[0];
                  for(int j = 1; j < primes.length && pf <= N && N != 1; j++){
                      pf = pf * primes[j];
                      count++;
                      }
                  System.out.println(count);  
          } // countPrimeFactors
         ```
         - Or just to calculate maximum primes for every target value (slowest method).
         ```
         C++:
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <stdlib.h>

         unsigned long long int gcd(unsigned long long int a, unsigned long long int b)
         {

            while (b) {
               unsigned long long int t = b;

               b = a % b;
               a = t;
            }
            return a;
         }

         unsigned int max_unique_primes(unsigned long long int n)
         {
            unsigned int count;
            unsigned long long int prod;
            unsigned long long int prim;

            if (n < 2)
               return 0;

            prod = 2;
            count = 1;
            for (prim = 3; prod * prim <= n; prim += 2) {
               if (gcd(prod, prim) == 1) {
                  prod *= prim;
                  count++;
               }
            }
            return count;
         }

         int main(void)
         {
            unsigned int q;

            if (scanf("%u", &q) != 1)
               return EXIT_FAILURE;

            while (q--) {
               unsigned long long int n;

               if (scanf("%llu", &n) != 1)
                  return EXIT_FAILURE;

               printf("%u\n", max_unique_primes(n));
            }
            return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
         ```
   - explanation:
      - The question is asking about what is the maximum factors, that are prime numbers could be found in the corresponding range of n.
      - For example, 3*5*7 = 105, then in the range from 1 to 105, there are at most 3 prime **factors**.
   
**5. connectingTowns(StackOverflowError)**
   - status: **Failed due to some technique issues**
   - ans: 
      - initial-ans:
      ```
      int r = 1;
      for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
         r *= routes[i];
      }
      r %= 1234567;
      return r;
      ```
      - recommended-ans:
      ```
      int r = 1;
      for (int i=0, i < n - 1; i++) {
         r = r*routes[n]%1234567;
      }
      return r;
      ```
   - explanation: 
      - **Remember to initialise all values before using it.**
      - Modulus arthimatic works no matter it is multiple before it or after it.
      - `StackOerflowError`: **Important - May experience multiple times when facing mathematics-related questions.**
         - A runtime error when the amount of call stack memory allocated by JVM is exceeded.
         - A common case is that the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.
      - **From now on, every count would be named as `c`.**

**6. cuttingSquares(BigInteger)**
   - status: **Failed**
   - ans: `n*m - 1`
      - correct-ans:
      ```
      Dealing with large integers:
      
      Java(Understandable solution):
      
      static long solve(int n, int m) {
         return BigInteger.valueOf(n).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(m)).longValue()-1;
      }
      
      Java(Intersting solution):

      public class Solution {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
              long m = in.nextLong();
              long n = in.nextLong();
              long cuts = m*n-1;
              System.out.println(cuts);
          }
      }
      
      public class Solution {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
              int n = in.nextInt();
              int m = in.nextInt();
              long result = (long)n*(long)m;
              System.out.println(result - 1);
          }
      }
      ```
   - explanation:
      - A single square takes zero cuts.
      - Every time a piece of paper is cut once to become 2 pieces, adding 1 to the total number of pieces.
      - A rectange of n squares takes `n - 1` cuts, adding rows or columns of m squares, the results would be `n*m - 1`.
         - Regarding the n and m, n*m is the area of the target paper, which is also the no. of papers we needed.
      - The problem is with the multiplication of the inputs, which is in `int` type.
         - The multiplication of `int` types overflows, which starts again from its minimum limit.
         - If any one of the inputs (either `n` or `m` is casted to `long`), the problem could be prevented.
   
**7. movingTiles(Velocity + RunTimeError + Math.cos())**
   - status: **Success after father's help and checking discussion**
   - ans: 
      - `Velocity = Displacement / Change-in-Time`
      - `Area = (x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2) [in time i]`
         - `Area = (l - 0) * (l - 0) [in time 0]`
         - `Area = ((l + s1*cos(45[degree])*i) - s2*cos(45[degree]*i)) * ((l + s1*cos(45[degree])*i) - s2*cos(45[degree]*i))`
         - `Area = (l + (s1 - s2)*cos(45[degree]*i))`
         - `r[i] = Math.abs((Math.sqrt(queries[i]) - l) / ((s1 - s2)*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(45))));`
      - preferred-ans: The given-codes have runtime problem that have to be solved manually.

              scanner.close();
          }
      }
      ```
   - explanation:
      - We have to calculate `i` given the target area, but for simplicity, we just construct a area formula first.
      - `qi` is the target area that we want to calculate, and thus the information we need to find out is the top right point of the square with lower velocity and the bottom left point of the other square with higher velocity.
      - Noticeably, The overlapping area of tiles would become smaller and smaller.
         - Consider the absolute value of the difference in velocities, we get the relative velocity.
         - The velocity is restricted to an angle of 45, which then we evaluate it as cos45 or sin45.
         - The `Math.cos()` receives input of radian instead of degree, which we need a transformation using `Math.toRadian()`.
      - **The `int` data type is often unreliable with mathematical calculations, `long` or `BigInteger` is preferred more.
      - **For all arrays with for loops used, the i should be set at 0 with only "<" used as the condition.**

      The only difference above is the loop that adds up the digits, which one uses a for-loop and one uses a while loop.
      It is more suitable to use the while loop, as the for loop can not produce the correct digits as it is changed to long type instead of int type.

   - explanation:
      - **The inputs inside and outside of a method can be the same in competitive programming.**
      - **Some methods are self-designed and some are pre-designed, but both of them are methods(seems obvious but actually no).**
      - **Add space between the name of methods and constructors and the brackets.**
      - **Remember the variable to be assigned must be put to the left of the equality.**
      - **Boolean flag would be set as `fg` from now on.**
      - **`break` terminates the current loop statement and move on to the next line of codes.**
      - **All inputs for methods would be called `in` if `r` is used.**
      - **All outputs for methods would be called `ot` if `r` is used.**
      - **All smaller variables after should be set with the bigger one with the last vocab.**
      - **The temperary variable from now on would be called `tm`.**
      - **A blank class should be set so to test out small problems in competitive programming(as a beginner).**
      - **If a number cannot be divisible for another number, the output would be 0.**
      - ** Keep the codes as simple as possible.**
      - **Never use `int` to do mathematical questions, use `long` instead.**
      - **Competitive programming is about finding the most efficient way to finish the task. That's it.**
      - **Remember if any `double` type is used, the `int` calculation would become `double`, which the remainder removal is not applied to the calculation anymore.**

   - explanation:
      - Greatest factor of a number does not equal to the greatest common factor of two numbers, even if those two number multiplies and become that number.
         - Instead, the greatest number of that number must be one of the two numbers, which is definitely not the target number.
      - The method I used is problematic, after testing of changing to other variable types. But why?

   - explanation:
      - **The most important thing about mathematics is about finding out the principles of data, which some of them is found decades ago with generalisation performed, some of them has to be found out by yourself.(In condition of competitive programming.)**
      - **From now on, all array would be named as `arr`.**
      - The question asked for the position of ball numbered `k` instead of the ball at position `k`.
      - **Be careful of outputing the inputs, which could be more than one. If the question did not provide enough codes, you may have to write it yourself.**
      - **From now on, the iteration of pairs of inputs is named as `titr` which stands for `iterations of t`.**
      - `n` only indicates the no. of each numbers, but the actuall max. number is `n - 1`.
      - There is two formula(two trends) in this question and we must find a way to decide whether the input number belongs to which formula.
         - Either by finding whether the number is bigger or smaller to the major part of the range from 1 to n: `k >= (n - 1) - k`
	 - Or by finding whether the no. belongs to the part larger or smaller than the middle number of the range from 1 to n, with the fidnings of whether the number range is even or odd: `n % 2 == 0`
	 - Tho actually the actual range is from 0 to n-1.

      Let the fraction a / b in its reduced form be the slope of the line joining P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2), which is equal to (y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2).
      
      To get all the points with integral coordinates, lying on the line PQ and between P and Q, we need to keep moving b units in the x-direction and a unit in the y-direction, starting from P until we reach Q.
      
      So the number of such points (excluding P and Q) is given by n, where
      
      n = abs((y1 - y2)/a) - 1
      
      or equivalently,
      
      n = abs((x1 - x2)/b) - 1
      
      However, since

      and

      where 
      
      g = gcd(y1 - y2, x1 - x2)
      
      we have
      
      n = abs(g) - 1
      
      To express a fraction x/y in its reduced form, we divide x and y by gcd(x, y). For example, to get the reduced form of 2/4, we have to divide the numerator(dividend) and denominator(divisor) by 2 = gcd(2, 4).
      ```
      ```
      static long solve(long x1, long y1, long x2, long y2) {
    	long g = gcdByEuclidsAlgorithm(y2 - y1, x2 - x1);
    	long r = (long)Math.abs(g) - 1;
    	return r;
    	
    }
    
    static long gcdByEuclidsAlgorithm(long n1, long n2) {
    	if (n2 == 0) {
    		return n1;
    	}
    	return gcdByEuclidsAlgorithm(n2, n1 % n2);
      }
      ```
   - explanation:
      - forms for the equation of a line:
         - slope-intercept: `y = m(slope)x+ b(y-intercept)`
	 - two-point form: `(y - y1) / (x - x1) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`
	 - point-slope: `y - y1 = m(x - x1)`
	 - standard form: `a(must be positive)x + by = c`
	 - intercept form: `x/a + y/b = 1`
	 - vertical: `x = a(x-intercept)`
	 - horizontal: `y = b`
      - **Remember if the condition is set at its lower limit, the initialisation of `i` must be bigger than that.**
      - **In many math problems, it is useful to find an invariant, which is the slope in this question.**
      - The slope in reduced form would give the smallest rise and run from one point to the next. So in total `abs(gcd(rise, run)) - 1` times(minus one because of the outer point).
         - `(y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2) = ((y1 - y2)/gcd)/((x1 - x2)/gcd) [reduced]`
      - **Usually in mathematic questions, divide-and-conquer method is often not the best solution.**
      - In `BigInteger` class, `[firstValue].gcd([secondValue])` could be used to find the gcd.
